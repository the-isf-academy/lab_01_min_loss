# Lab: Minimizing loss

In this lab, students will come up with strategies for finding a good line to summarize two-dimensional data using a loss function developed in a previous lab

## Jupyter Notebook Workflow

As a reminder, the workflow for using Jupyter notebooks with git is as follows:

* `git clone` or `git pull` the Jupyter notebook repo to your local directory
* run `jupyter notebook` in your working directory
* open the .Rmb file
* Save cmd+S the file
* Close and halt the .Rmb file
* Open the .ipynb file and edit as usual (this will save the output as usual while automatically updating the .Rmb file)
